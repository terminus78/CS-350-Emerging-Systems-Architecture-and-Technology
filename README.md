# CS-350-Emerging-Systems-Architecture-and-Technology

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

> I was working for the ficticious company SysTec, and they wanted to prototype a smart thermostat. I used a TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3220S microcontroller to build this thermostat.

**What did you do particularly well?**

> I built a very efficient and simple state machine. I was ingeniously straightforward and minimalistic.

**Where could you improve?**

> I could improve on my understanding of the inner workings of Code Composer Studio and the TI functions. This knowledge would help me to develop more efficiently.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

> My support network now includes a plethora of technical resources about the TI microcontrollers, embedded systems technology, and tools to help develop these systems.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

> My newfound understanding of resource efficency and speed of operation in a limited enviroment will enable me to create code that is more intentional in managing the balancing act between speed and resource usage.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

> I used expressive variable names, used whitespace effectively, and added comments where necessary to improve code readability without causing clutter.
